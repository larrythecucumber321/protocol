```

### deploy

Deploys an instance of the entire system, oriented around some mandate.
The mandate describes what goals its governors should try to achieve. By succinctly
explaining the RTokenâ€™s purpose and what the RToken is intended to do, it provides common
ground for the governors to decide upon priorities and how to weigh tradeoffs.
Example Mandates:
- Capital preservation first. Spending power preservation second. Permissionless
access third.
- Capital preservation above all else. All revenues fund the over-collateralization pool.
- Risk-neutral pursuit of profit for token holders.
Maximize (gross revenue - payments for over-collateralization and governance).
- This RToken holds only FooCoin, to provide a trade for hedging against its
possible collapse.
The mandate may also be a URI to a longer body of text


```solidity
function deploy(
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    string calldata mandate,
    address owner,
    DeploymentParams memory params
) external returns (address);
```
